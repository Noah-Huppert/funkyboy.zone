		<h2>Installation and Configuration</h2>

		<p>
		Configuration files and package installation is managed by 
		a tool named 
		<a href="https://www.saltstack.com/">Salt</a>.<br>
		<br>
		If you would like to change configuration or install a package
		you must do so via Salt. If you do not then it is possible 
		that your changes will be lost if the server is re-setup 
		with Salt<br>
		<br>
		Salt configuration files are stored in the 
		<a href="https://github.com/Noah-Huppert/funkyboy.zone">Funky 
		Boy GitHub repository</a>. See instructions in this repository 
		for more information.

	    <h2>SSH Access</h2>

	    <p>
		   To access the Funkyboy server use SSH on the default port:
		   <br>
		   <code>ssh USERNAME@funkyboy.zone</code>
	    </p>
	</section>

	<section id="installation-and-configuration">
		<h2>Installation and Configuration</h2>

		<p>
		Configuration files and package installation is managed by 
		a tool named 
		<a href="https://www.saltstack.com/">Salt</a>.<br>
		<br>
		If you would like to change configuration or install a package
		you must do so via Salt. If you do not then it is possible 
		that your changes will be lost if the server is re-setup 
		with Salt<br>
		<br>
		Salt configuration files are stored in the 
		<a href="https://github.com/Noah-Huppert/funkyboy.zone">Funky 
		Boy GitHub repository</a>. See instructions in this repository 
		for more information.

	<section id="backups">
		<h2>Backups</h2>

		<p>
			Backups are made every day at midnight. Backups older 
			than a month are deleted unless they were made on the 
			28th of a month. Backups older than a year are deleted.
			<br>
			<br>
			User home and 
			<a href="https://public.funkyboy.zone">public</a> 
			directories are backed up. Files and directories who's 
			names start with a dot (Glob: <code>.*</code>) are 
			not backed up.<br>
			<br>
			State data for the following services is also backed up:

			<ul>
				<li>Factorio Saves</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="services">
	    <h2>Services</h2>

	    <p>
		   Long running processes are called services. They are managed using
		   a tool called <a href="http://smarden.org/runit">Runit</a>.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   Services live in the <code>/etc/sv/</code> directory. There is a
		   directory for each service. The name of the directory is the name of
		   the service. Inside service directories there is a <code>run</code>
		   script. This is typically a bash script which launches the service.
		   Although the script can be any executable.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   To administer services use the <code>vsv</code> command. This tool uses
		   the pattern <code>vsv COMMAND SERVICE</code>. There are many commands
		   which you can run, however the most common are:

		   <ul>
			  <li>
				 <code>vsv status SERVICE</code> retrieves the status of
				 a service.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				 <code>vsv start SERVICE</code> starts a service.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				 <code>vsv stop SERVICE</code> stops a service.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				 <code>vsv restart SERVICE</code> restarts a service.
			  </li>
		   </ul>

		   Most users do not have access to most services. However certain
		   services have been setup so users can control them.

	<section id="factorio">
	    <h2>Factorio</h2>

	    <p>
		   A Factorio game server is available at
		   <code>factorio.funkyboy.zone</code>. You can download the installed
		   mods at
		   <a href="https://factorio-mods.funkyboy.zone">
			  factorio-mods.funkyboy.zone
		   </a>.

	    </p>

	    <h3>Directories</h3>

	    <p>
		   The <code>/opt/factorio</code> directory contains almost all
		   Factorio game server files. The relevant sub-directories are:
		   
		   <ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>config/</b>: Server settings.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				 <b>mods/</b>: Game mods.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				 <b>saves/</b>: Game saves.
			  </li>
		   </ul>

		   Additionally the <code>/etc/sv/factorio</code> directory contains
		   the Factorio game service files.
	    </p>

	    <h3>Service Management</h3>

	    <p>
		   A Factorio server is hosted as a
		   <a href="#services"><i>service</i></a>.

		   Some users have been given permission to administer this service. 

		   <ul>
			  <li>
				 Its name is <code>factorio</code>.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				 To restart it run <code>vsv restart factorio</code>.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				 Currently running <code>vsv status factorio</code> will
				 produce a funky looking output. It may look like the service
				 is down according to the "STATE" column of this command's
				 output. For now look at the "TIME" column. If there is a time
				 and a "pid" in this column the server is probably running. If
				 there a message about "normally up" in the "TIME" column the
				 server is probably down. I am working on this issue. When in
				 doubt run <code>vsv start factorio</code>.
			  </li>
		   </ul>

		   See the <a href="#services">services section</a> for more details on
		   service administration.
